Socket programming in Java allows us to create network applications that can communicate over a network using sockets. Sockets provide a low-level communication mechanism for sending and receiving data over a network. This is a practice repository to gather hand on experience on java socket programming.

    Basic Overview:

Socket: A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. In Java, there are two types of sockets: ServerSocket for server-side communication and Socket for client-side communication.

Server Socket: To create a server socket, we use the ServerSocket class.

Client Socket: To create a client socket, we use the Socket class.

Communication: Once the client and server sockets are connected, they can send and receive data using input and output streams (InputStream and OutputStream) or readers and writers (Reader and Writer).

Closing Sockets: It's essential to close sockets and associated resources when we're done with them to release system resources properly. We can use close() method to close the sockets.

Exception Handling: Socket programming can throw various exceptions like IOException. Proper error handling is essential to ensure our program behaves gracefully.

Multithreading: For handling multiple client connections simultaneously, we'll typically use multithreading or asynchronous programming. In the server example above, a ClientHandler class is created for each client connection, and it's responsible for handling communication with that client.

Socket programming in Java can be more complex when dealing with more advanced scenarios such as handling multiple clients concurrently, dealing with timeouts, and implementing robust error handling. It's also important to consider security aspects, such as encryption and authentication, when building real-world network applications.
